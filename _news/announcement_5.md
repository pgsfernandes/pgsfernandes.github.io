I am thrilled to announce that I have joined the Quantum Gravity group at CP3-Origins, University of Southern Denmark, for a two-year postdoctoral position. This opportunity is a milestone in my academic journey, and I couldn't be more excited!

I will have the privilege of collaborating closely with [Astrid Eichhorn](https://inspirehep.net/authors/1065259?ui-citation-summary=true), a leading expert in the fascinating realms of quantum gravity and black hole physics. Her research in these areas perfectly aligns with my interests, and I look forward to both contributing to and learning from her work!

Here are a few snapshots from my initial weeks in Denmark! :smiley:
