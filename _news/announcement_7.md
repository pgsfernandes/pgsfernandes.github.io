A preprint of my recent work "Shadows and properties of spin-induced scalarized black holes with and without a Ricci coupling" with Astrid Eichhorn, Thomas Sotiriou and Clare Burrage is now available [here](https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.14596). **Update:** you can find the published version [here](https://journals.aps.org/prd/abstract/10.1103/PhysRevD.109.104033).
