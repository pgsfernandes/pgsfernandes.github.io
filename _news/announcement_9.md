I am visiting Perimeter Institute in Waterloo, Canada, from the 8th to the 26th of July, and attended the "[50 years of Horndeski Gravity](https://events.perimeterinstitute.ca/event/66/overview)" conference, where I gave a talk. I was lucky to have met and to take a photo with the man himself, Gregory Horndeski!
