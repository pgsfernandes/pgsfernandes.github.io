I visited the Perimeter Institute in Waterloo, Canada, from July 8th to July 26th. During my stay, I attended the "[50 years of Horndeski Gravity](https://events.perimeterinstitute.ca/event/66/overview)" conference and gave a talk. I was fortunate to meet Gregory Horndeski in person and even got a photo with him!
